# fifa-2022-data-analysis

In this project, I did data analysis and visualization of FIFA 2022 data from [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/stefanoleone992/fifa-22-complete-player-dataset). 

Through analysis, I predict which team will pass the group stage for the group H:
- Korea Republic
- Portugal
- Uruguay
- Ghana

The analysis tells me that Portugal and Uruguay will pass the group stage.
