# fifa-2022-data-analysis

In this project, I did data analysis and visualization of FIFA 2023 data from [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sanjeetsinghnaik/fifa-23-players-dataset). 

Through analysis, I predict which team will pass the group stage for the group H:
- Korea Republic
- Portugal
- Uruguay
- Ghana

The [analysis](https://github.com/deep-deep-learning/2022-world-cup-data-analysis/blob/main/data_analysis.ipynb) tells me that Portugal and Uruguay will pass the group stage.
